## Hi and welcome to my GitHub page! :sun_with_face:

My name is Yair (pronunced as two syllables: ya-ir)

I'm a data scientist with a deep passion for solving analytical business problems with data :bar_chart: :memo: 

Currently I'm transitioning into the data science world in the industry, after 10 years of doing data science in academia as part of my research in experimental linguistics.

In addition to the academic hands-on experience, I hold a certificate for completing an immersive data science program with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/new-york-city?&topic=&mkt_account_id=1056949875&mkt_campaign_id=1593581982&mkt_ad_group_id=62799259840&mkt_device_type=c&mkt_keyword=+data%20+science%20+general%20+assembly&mkt_matchtype=b&mkt_placement=&mkt_ad_id=550687248151&mkt_network=g&mkt_target_id=kwd-333766301885&mkt_feed_item_id=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search-bra&utm_campaign=TS:TX:BRA:NYC:BRTP:DAT:DataScience:GeneralAssembly&utm_content=PDP-PT&utm_term=+data%20+science%20+general%20+assembly&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnoqLBhD4ARIsAL5JedJBeYWCu5W7CbKaVbvgvuMhuR1Y1W_oVFMlQb_hpRE2uuHsupbuqzEaAvk8EALw_wcB), during which I acquired and extended my skills with Machine Learning tools with the aim of using data to solve real-world business problems.

This repository contains data science projects I've been working on. Comments and suggestions are more than welcome!
